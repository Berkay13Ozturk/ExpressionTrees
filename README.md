A basic example to show my coding style, using an expression tree implementation. Application includes creating the tree, evaluating the expression, few unit tests etc.

Please refer to the code analysis file to see the code metrics and possible defect analysis. 

Traversal Methods:
    /* Breadth First and Depth Traversal Method(s) */
  - Level order
  - Pre order
  - In order
  - Post order

Allowed Expression(s):
    /* The list can easily be expanded */
  - Cube
  - Square
  - Multiply
  - Division
  - Addition
  - Subtraction

Prune Feature:
    /* The nested expressions can further be pruned into a single constant after calculating its value */

Tree Creation:
    /* A binary expression tree can either be created using a level-by-level approach or it can be defined once specifying the whole tree */
